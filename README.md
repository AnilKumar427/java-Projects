projects using #Java

hey Aliens!
  I have written a code for a ticket machine which is used to issue Tickets in the public transport Buses of (TSRTC).
  You can checkout the whole code written by me on the next file.
  haha just with a random thought i have made this using the essentials of #java 
  Ok....coming to the scenario ,
    I took a bus called "277L" as my reference for writing the code for ticket-wending-machine.
    This bus '277L' travels between the places "L.B-Nagar" to "Ibrahimpatnam(IBP)" 
    The bus Departures from the area L.B-Nagar and travels to the final destination called 'IBP' over 15 Stops :
    
  Bus Code: 277L          NO.of.Stops: 15        M.R.P of Ticket: Varies with range between Stops !
       
        1.L.B nagar        (Bus Starts Here)
        2.sagar x-road
        3.Omkar Nagar
        4.hastinapur
        5.bn-reddy
        6.sagar complex 
        7.gurramguda
        8.injapur 
        9.emjyal 
        10.ragannaguda
        11.manneguda 
        12.bongloor 
        13.mangalpally 
        14.sheriguda 
        15.ibrahimpatnam    (Bus Stops here)
      
 hey there! 
  # i wanna tell you that i had written the code only for one way Route i.e, from 'L.B-nagar' to 'IBP'
  # the ticket prices are just as per my random declarations....
  # i took the ticket of local tsrtc buses of hyderabad as a reference to create the exact output of the ticket !
 
 HOW MY CODE WORKS?

1.firstly after opening the 'Ticket-wending-macine' it asks about the boarding Stop !
    by showing some Bus-stops between the L.B-Nagar & IBP  like:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       Choosing the Boarding & Destination Stop:
       1.L.B nagar 2.sagar x-road 3.OMKAR NAGAR 4.hastinapur 5.bn-reddy 6.sagar complex 7.gurramguda 8.injapur 9.emjyal 
       10.ragannaguda 11.manneguda 12.bongloor 13.mangalpally 14.sheriguda 15.ibrahimpatna

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.After displaying the Options we have to enter the Boarding Stop of the PAssenger !
And then the code will ask for the Departure Stop of the Passenger ! in the Manner:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Choose the Departure Stop:
       1.L.B nagar 2.sagar x-road 3.OMKAR NAGAR 4.hastinapur 5.bn-reddy 6.sagar complex 7.gurramguda 8.injapur 9.emjyal 
       10.ragannaguda 11.manneguda 12.bongloor 13.mangalpally 14.sheriguda 15.ibrahimpatnam
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.the ticket is printed in the format like :
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
             ***TSRTC(HYDERABAD)***
                FROM : LB-NAGAR
                TO : SAGAR COMPLEX
                 FARE: RS:35/- 
                  Thank you!
               ..Happy journey..
